<h2><a href="photographs/mimic.html">Mimic</a></h2>

<div class="project-description">My goal was to capture objects and personifying them in a way captures a concept, conveys a feeling, or makes use of symbolism. Many of my photographs play with ideas related to COVID-19 and its effects I see in my day to day life. Almost every aspect of my life has been affected in one way or another. Whether we like it or not, discussing this subject has engulfed everyone and is one of the most relevant shared experiences present at this time. Objects can have all different types of meaning and significance yet this widespread virus has challenged many of our assumed beliefs and accepted values. A byproduct of the pandemic is we are seeing things in new light. How can I capture the shift in ideals and focus in a still image? What feelings do I want to translate? What subjects would show the most compelling story?</div>

<h2><a href="photographs/black-and-white.html">Black and White</a></h2>

<div class="project-description">
  My goal was to shoot in black and white to develop an eye for the challenge of capturing moments without the full spectrum of color though which I normally see the world. Photography as we know it today looks very different from what the first photographers experienced. Shooting in black and white is an option now and we have practically unlimited storage as opposed to film which had a fixed number of exposures. Even though the art of photography is relatively new compared to other art forms like drawing, painting, and sculpture, the advances in the field have been tremendous. I was particularly interested in going back to photography's origins as a means to learn more about and appreciate the medium. Unlike the sensors in modern cameras that mimic human perception of light and color on the spectrum, monochromatic photos are just composed of different shades of grey. Knowing the final results are restricted to black and white, there are different aspects of setting up and capturing a shot that will become particularly important to consider. The tonal contrast, light sources, shadows, and texture are just a few that will be at the forefront of my mind as I shoot and highlight the value of the absence of color.

<h2><a href="photographs/portraits.html">Portraits</a></h2>

<div class="project-description">My goal is to capture people along with an aspect of personality within my photographs. Portrait photography has always been a welcomed challenge of mine. One of the most rewarding parts of photography for me is being able to take a photograph of someone that makes them smile and feel good about themselves. People are an interesting subjects since they have an identity and can communicate a reaction to an image unlike inanimate objects, plants, and animals. I try to dissolve into the background as much as possible in my process. As someone who prefers to stay behind the camera, I understand the unease and feeling of awkwardness of having a lens pointed right at you. It is important to me to capture the subject in a way that makes them feel empowered. In order to achieve this, I believe getting to know the subject on a personal level is integral to the process. This information can not only break down the barrier between them and the camera, but it can also contribute to the complex set of decisions that go into the capturing the moment.</div>
