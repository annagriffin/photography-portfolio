  <h1>About the Project</h1>

  <p>I began this project in search of different ways I could capture the world around me as it stands the test of time. As I am nearing a very monumental transition in my life, I can't help but think, "Where has the time gone?"</p>

  <p>Time is a fascinating concept, it is constantly change, yet always consistent. Our lives are made up of infinite little moments through which we experience the world. There are times when I wish it would slow down while in others, all I can think about is its passing. I made the decision a few years ago to focus on living in the moment, learning from the past, and aspiring for the future.</p>
  
  <p>This state of mind seeps into my interest in photography as it is a medium that acts as a remote controller with just the pause functionality. We can't stop time, but photographs can preserve an instance albeit in a way that is different than the lived experience.</p>
  
  <p>When I look through the view finder, I am reminded that I represent just one perspective out of a sea of millions. The motivation from this project comes from an interest in slowing down and using photography as a medium to communicate the lens through which I am experiencing my surroundings.</p>

  <h3>Inspiration</h3>

  <p><strong><a href="http://100photos.time.com/">100 Photos Project</a></strong> - TIME Magazine, 100 most influential images collection, 2016</p>
  
  <p>Over the course of three years, TIME curated a list of 100 photos they deemed to be the most influential photographs of all time. Experts from all different fields, photographers, photo editors, historians, and more, came together to not only put together a strong list of influential photographs, but to also share and uncover the stories behind them.</p> 

  <p>The project demonstrates that behind a picture there are a thousands words. Each photograph is accompanied by a short narrative putting the image in context which also sheds light into the reason it made the list. Choosing 100 photographs from the overgrowing collection that is multiplying as we speak is an ambitious goal that required a lot of thought, time, and effort. The written pieces that accompany the images from this collection enhance the my experience as a viewer and justify why they made the collection. </p>

  <p>Since I will not be showcasing all of the photos I take, I have to go through an alike process when selecting which images to keep and which ones to leave out. This part of my project required a lot of intentional decisions that weren't always easy to make. I drew from the role of the written pieces in the TIMES Magazine project to supplement my images with context and story. </p>

  <p><strong>The Photographers' Gallery: Viewpoints</strong> - Many artists, multi-media writings, N/A</p>

  <p>Through both “wide angle” and “focused” lenses, the gallery publishes new perspectives on all aspects of photography. Each Viewpoint focuses on a theme with curated content from writings, interviews, audio-visual material, articles, and more to demonstrate the breadth of the topic. The Photographers’ Gallery aims to get readers to think about the role of photography in contemporary culture and spark curiosity.</p>

  <p>While each photo in the Viewpoints share a common theme, there is an incredible range of interpretation and style. Since there is an experimental aspect to my project, I want to capture the wide range exploration that can be done within each of the top level themes I chose. </p>

  <p><strong>Re-Framing Photography</strong> - Stefanie Michels, text excerpt, 2018</p>
  <p>With the introduction of smartphones, almost everyone carries around a camera in their pockets. As photography has gotten more accessible, it has evolved with the influence of "citizen photographers". Unlike the film photography process where you had to develop the negatives and then print to be able to truly see what got captured, we can not instantly delete the records we don't want to preserve. With the invention of social media, the selection process has also evolved for a different audience and platform. Now these decisions are social driven and people's personal collections are self curated.</p>

  <p><strong>Anni Albers Selected Writing on Design</strong> - Anni Albers, collection of essays, 2001</p>
  <p>Anni Albers is an incredibly talented and insightful writer. She believes that artists' work inherently keeps a record of history and it is a privilege to be able to view it. Art and usefulness are often kept at a distance in the modern, industrialized world but Albers argues that this doesn't have to be the case. The process of making something can determine its artistic qualities. I embraced this principle transforming ordinary objects and settings though my eyes.</p>


  <p><strong>Fan Ho</strong></p>

  <p>Fan Ho was a Chinese photographer that spent a lot of time documenting on the streets of Hong Kong. His work is known for capturing the people of Hong Kong. Ho shot in black and white making incredible use of light, shadows, and composition. One of his most well known images is "Approaching Shadow" which is simple yet captivating. The shadow in this photograph is like another subject in addition to the woman. Without it, it would not be nearly as striking, but it cuts across the large part of the wall providing a unique, temporary contrast. His work brings out the connection between Hong Kong and its people while doing so in black and white.</p>
